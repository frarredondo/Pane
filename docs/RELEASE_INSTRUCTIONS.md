# Pane Release Instructions

Pane releases are cut from a clean `main` checkout with `scripts/release.js`.
The script updates `package.json`, commits `release: vX.Y.Z`, tags the same
commit, pushes `HEAD:main`, and pushes the tag.

## Mechanical Invariants

Before a release, these facts must be true:

- The worktree is clean.
- `HEAD` matches `origin/main`.
- For inferred bumps (`patch`, `minor`, `major`), `package.json` version matches
  the latest `v*` semver tag.
- The release tag does not already exist locally or on `origin`.

If `package.json` and the latest release tag disagree, do not run an inferred
patch. Decide the intended next version and run an explicit release instead:

```bash
pnpm run release 2.2.1
```

## Happy Path

```bash
git switch main
git pull --ff-only origin main
git status --porcelain
git tag --list 'v*' --sort=-v:refname | head -5
node -p "require('./package.json').version"

pnpm typecheck
pnpm lint
pnpm test:ci:minimal

pnpm run release patch
```

Use `minor`, `major`, or an explicit version when that is the intended release:

```bash
pnpm run release minor
pnpm run release major
pnpm run release 2.3.0
```

## GitHub Workflows

Pull requests to `main` run:

- `Code Quality`
  - typecheck
  - lint
  - main process tests on Linux, macOS, and Windows
  - frontend unit tests
  - maintained Playwright smoke tests

Pushes to `main` run:

- `Code Quality`
- `Deploy Remote PWA Preview`

`v*` tag pushes run:

- `Build & Release`
  - macOS universal installer
  - Linux installer artifacts
  - Windows x64 installer
  - Windows arm64 installer
  - GitHub release publishing
  - `SHA256SUMS.txt`
- `Notify website on release`

The release is not considered complete until the tag-triggered `Build & Release`
run succeeds and the GitHub release is published.

## Verification

After `pnpm run release ...` finishes:

```bash
git fetch origin main --tags
git rev-parse HEAD
git rev-parse origin/main
git tag --points-at HEAD
gh run list --limit 10
gh release view vX.Y.Z
```

Confirm:

- `HEAD` and `origin/main` point at the release commit.
- The release commit has the expected `vX.Y.Z` tag.
- `Build & Release` succeeded for the tag.
- `Notify website on release` succeeded for the tag.
- `Code Quality` succeeded for the release commit on `main`.
- `Deploy Remote PWA Preview` succeeded for the release commit on `main`.

## Required Secrets

GitHub Actions provides `GITHUB_TOKEN` automatically.

The release and preview workflows also depend on repository secrets and
variables configured in GitHub Actions. Relevant examples include:

- `SITE_REPO_DISPATCH_TOKEN` for website release notification.
- Google Cloud workload identity, service account, project, and region values
  for the remote PWA preview deploy.
- Platform signing or publishing credentials if signing is re-enabled.

## Auto-Update Files

The build process generates update metadata and installers under
`dist-electron/` in the release workflow:

- `latest-mac.yml`
- `latest-linux.yml`
- `latest-linux-arm64.yml`
- `latest.yml`
- macOS `.dmg` and `.zip`
- Linux `.deb` and `.AppImage`
- Windows `.exe`

## Rollback

Do not retag an existing version. If a release has a critical issue:

1. Fix the issue on `main`.
2. Cut a new patch version.
3. Leave the broken tag/release history intact unless maintainers explicitly
   decide to remove it.

Users can always manually download the latest good release from GitHub Releases.
